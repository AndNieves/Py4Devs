    Given the test page provided, create the following tests cases and a mocked version of the webservice to test them.
    Use selenium to automate web interaction, and the test framework you like best to write the tests cases.

    Tips:
        To run your server locally, use: python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT>
        To run your mocked service, use: python service_mock.py
        Be careful to use port 8888 for your service or change it in index.html if you are using other value

    Challenge: Try to serve the mocked server answers from a datasource like a text file, excel spread sheet or a database
